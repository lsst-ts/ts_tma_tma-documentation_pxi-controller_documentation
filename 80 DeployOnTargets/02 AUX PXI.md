## AUX PXI

- Is not a NI (National Instruments) HW, it is a Beckhoff PC: C5210-0040 series (due to big waiting lists at NI)
- It could be replaced by NI hardware, but is not as easy as replacing the AXEs one, this one may require some changes
inside the cabinet to make room for it.

### Compiled code

The code generated by the `AuxSystemsController.lvproj` must be copied to the `/c/ni-rt/startup` directory.

The content of `/c/ni-rt/startup` directory should look like this:

```bash
admin@AuxSystems:/c/ni-rt/startup# ls -lh
total 30996
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    administ      22 Apr 25  2020 README_File_Paths.txt -> /README_File_Paths.txt

admin@AuxSystems:/c/ni-rt/startup#
```

### Configuration files

This section explains the location and which are the configuration files needed for this PXI. All the same structure,
the main configuration files are stored in the `/c/Configuration` directory, here some are then inside other directories
to make things more clear. But each of them contains the specific configuration files for the code running in it.

Now each of the files is explained:

- **TMA_PXI_RT_MainConfig.ini:** This file is automatically created if not existent, is used to define the general
configuration. If empty the default values are used, this is the way it is created if nonexistent at boot.
- **./CAR_TCP/CommandTCP_Config.xml:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration for the TCP server
used to communicate with the MtMountOperationManager is specified. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./DiscreteStateReporting/DiscreteStateReporting.json:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration
for the discrete state reporting task is specified. If not found the system will start but it won't be managing the
events properly, so duplicated events for the CSC could appear.
- **./ModbusTemperatureControllers/cabinetName_config.ini:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration for the
modbus communication for each temperature controller is specified. If not found at boot the code for the modbus controllers
won't startup.
- **./ModbusTemperatureControllers/cabinetName_mapping.txt:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the
configuration for the modbus mapping (shared variables between the PXI and the temperature controllers) is defined. If
not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./OSS/OSS_AdditionalFaultMonitoring.json:** This file is **necessary** at boot, this file defines which variables
are read for obtaining the detailed alarm list from the OSS system. Each variable has a list of bit in array format, this
string values will be sent when the corresponding bit is active.
- **./OSS/OSS_CabinetTemperatureMonitoring.json:** This file is **necessary** at boot, this file defines which variables
are read for monitoring the temperature of the OSS cabinets. It also defines under which names are published to the
event system.
- **./OSS/OSS_ModBusMapping.txt:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration for the OSS
modbus mapping (shared variables between the PXI and the OSS) is defined. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./OSS/OSS_ModBusMapping_ForReadWriteDefinition.txt:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the
configuration for the OSS variables inside the PXI is defined. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./OSS/ServerConfig.ini:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration for the modbus communication
is specified. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./TEC/ServerConfig.ini** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration for the modbus communication
is specified. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./TEC/TEC_ModBusMapping.txt** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration for the TEC
modbus mapping (shared variables between the PXI and the TEC) is defined. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./TEC/TEC_ModBusMapping_ForReadWriteDefinition.txt:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the
configuration for the TEC variables inside the PXI is defined. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./TEC/TopEndChillerCommandsAndMonitoringConfig.json:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the commands TEC
behavior is coded, a full explanation of the file can be found
[**here**](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_labview_pxi-controller/tree/develop/RT%20Code/TopEndChiller)
- **./TekNSVs/ReceiverConfig.xml:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration for the TCP server that
sends the TekNSV variables to the EUI is specified. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./TekNSVs/TekNSVvariablesToCreate.json:** This file is **necessary** at boot, this file defines the TekNSV variables
to create just after starting the server, this prevents errors at boot in the EUI when launched too early. If not found
at boot the code won't startup.
- **./TekNSVs/VariablesToSubscribe.json:** This file is **necessary** at boot, this file defines the TekNSV variables
to read from the TMA PXI. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./TekNSVs/VariablesToSubscribeClientConfig.xml:** This file is **necessary** at boot, here the configuration for the
TCP client to connect to the TekNSV server in the TMA PXI is defined. If not found at boot the code won't startup.
- **./TelemetryConfig/TelemetryConfig.ini:** This file is **necessary** at boot, this file defines the input signals to
read from the TMA PXI and the TekNSV variables to be published. If not found at boot the code won't startup.

The default configuration for all the **necessary** files listed here can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_labview_pxi-controller)
inside the `ESIFiles` directory.

#### TMA_PXI_RT_MainConfig

As this is the one that has the general information a specific section is created. This file can have multiple sections,
as a *.ini file, it uses `[sectionName]` to divide the file.

- `log` section: here the configuration for the logging is defined.
  - Path: the absolute path for the log files, it needs to have a main file name, a date is going to be added to it.
  Default value: `/home/lvuser/log/MainLogFile.log`
  - Active: a boolean "FALSE"/"TRUE" to disable/enable the logging. Default value: "TRUE".

  ```ini
  [Log]
  Path = "/home/lvuser/log/AuxTMA.log"
  Active = "TRUE"
  ```

- `Settings Database` section: here the configuration for connecting to the database is defined.
  - IP: the ip for the MCC machine that contains the database. Default: "192.168.209.200"
  - Port: the port to connect to the database. Default: 3306
  - Timeout: the timeout for the connect in ms. Default: 500
  - ReadTimeout: the timeout for reading from the database in ms. Default: 500
  - UserName: the user name to connect to the database. Default: "root"
  - Password: the password to connect to the database. The default is the password for connecting to the database.
  - DataBase: the name of the database to connect to. Default: "lsst_settings"

  ```ini
  [Settings Database]
  IP = "192.168.209.200"
  Port = 3306
  Timeout = 500
  ReadTimeout = 500
  UserName = "root"
  Password = "defaultPasswordValue"
  DataBase = "lsst_settings"
  ```

- `IPs` section: here the IPs for connecting to the different device targets are defined.
  - tmaPxiIp: specify the IP of the TMA PXI here, if not defined the default value will be used. Default: 192.168.209.10.
  - auxPxiIp: specify the IP of the AUX PXI here, if not defined the default value will be used. Default: 192.168.209.11.
  - axesPxiIp: specify the IP of the AXES PXI here, if not defined the default value will be used. Default: 192.168.213.11.
  - tmaIsIp: specify the IP of the TMA IS (safety PLC CPU module) here, if not defined the default value will be used. Default: 192.168.180.10.
  - mcc: specify the IP of the MCC here, if not defined the default value will be used. Default: 192.168.209.200.

  ```ini
  [IPs]
  tmaPxiIp = 139.229.171.3
  auxPxiIp = 139.229.171.4
  axesPxiIp = 139.229.171.26
  tmaIsIp = 192.168.180.10
  mcc = 139.229.171.6
  ```
