# Settings introduction

This section contains the documentation of the LabVIEW classes used for accessing the settings and events stored in the
database from LabVIEW. All the VIs used for communicating with the database are all hold in a separated
[repo](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_labview_settings-management)
and added as submodule in the [PXIController](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_labview_pxi-controller)
code and [HMIComputers](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_labview_hmi-computers)
repos.

For a deeper documentation about each VI refer to the [settingsmanagement repo](https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma_labview_settings-management).
