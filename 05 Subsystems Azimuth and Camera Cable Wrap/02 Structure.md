## Software Structure
The structure is slightly different for Azimuth or Camera cable wrap, since the first one is a subordinated subsystem, receives commands from Azimuth subsystem, and the second one is independent subsystem.

### Azimuth Cable Wrap

This subsystem is not an independent subsystem, it belongs to Azimuth axis. So, since AZCW is commanded by azimuth axis directly. There is ability to command the AZCW directly, but command is sent to azimuth subsystem which checks that all is OK to proceed with the command and then azimuth state machine sends the command to AZCW state machine. 
The state machine is the logic of the subsystem. This state machine is programmed using the TeknikerÂ´s statechart framework and executed in the statechart task. The CCW is an instance of Cable Wrap OMT statechart. The statechart will be managed by triggers that come from command reception task and from event task. The CCW has two Bosch motors, so the subsystem must command this motor trough the [Bosch task](../Bosch&nbsp;Task/Introduction.md#Bosch&nbsp;Task), sending commands to it. There is only one Bosch motor working, and a failure in this motor will generate and automatic motor change.
There is a task for events, the **monitoring and event task**. It will execute evaluation of events with some of the process values. This task also has some monitoring characteristics, but motor related data monitoring and publishing is performed by the Bosch task itself.
